## How to Build

You can build the program using the `go build` command:

> "go build"

To output the binary directly in the `Examples` directory, use the following command:

> "go build -o ./example/calc/"

## How to Run the Example

Assuming that the build system has been compiled and the executable is located in the `example` directory, you can run the example with the following command:

> "./BSc-build-systems.exe \"./calc\""

**Note:** The current prototype always builds a Linux binary.
